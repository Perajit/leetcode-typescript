Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1],
then return 0.

Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers.

Example 1:
  Input: x = 123
  Output: 321

Example 2:
  Input: x = -123
  Output: -321

Example 3:
  Input: x = 120
  Output: 21

Constraints:
  -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
