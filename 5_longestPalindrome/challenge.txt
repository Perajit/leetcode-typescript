Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.

You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
  Input: s = "babad"
  Output: "bab"
  Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
  Input: s = "cbbd"
  Output: "bb"

Constraints:
  1 <= s.length <= 1000
  s consist of only digits and English letters.
